# Calculator

Using html, css and javascript to create a responsive and functional calculator.
The calculator takes input from either the clickable user interface or the keyboard
and calculates an answer by operating on a pair of numbers at a time, i.e. 
For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = will yield 42:
12 + 7 = 19
19 - 5 = 14
14 * 3 = 42
